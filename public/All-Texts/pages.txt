ABOUT PAGE:

Hi, I'm Farhan, a full stack developer with a strong passion for creating beautiful, functional, and user-centered digital experiences. I hold an HBSc in Computer Science & Neuroscience from the University of Toronto, where I graduated with a cGPA of 3.93. My academic achievements were recognized with the UTSC International Scholar Award.

With 2 years of experience,  I am always looking for new and innovative ways to bring my clients' visions to life

In addition to web development, I have delved a lot into data analysis as well. As a Data Analyst at the Decision Neuroscience Lab, I have honed my skills in implementing data pipelines, analyzing large datasets with language models, and fine-tuning machine learning models for qualitative data labeling. 

Whether I'm working on a website, mobile app, or other data pipelines, I bring my whole hearted commitment to every project I work on.
